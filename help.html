  <h3>How to Play Checkers</h3>
  <p>Checkers is a classic board game played between two players on an 8x8 board. Here are the basic rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The board consists of 64 squares in alternating dark and light colors.</li>
    <li>Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of three rows closest to them.</li>
    <li>The pieces can move diagonally forward but can only occupy dark squares.</li>
    <li>To move, select one of your pieces and move it diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square.</li>
    <li>If your piece reaches the opponent's back row, it gets "kinged," allowing it to move backward as well.</li>
    <li>You can capture your opponent's pieces by jumping over them diagonally if the adjacent square is empty.</li>
    <li>A player wins by capturing all of their opponent's pieces</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>The primary objective is to capture all of your opponent's pieces!</p>

  <h3>Additional Information</h3>
  <p>White is always first in the turn order! Player 1 is white, and Player 2 is black.</p>
  <p>WHITE KING = ORANGE, BLACK KING = PURPLE</p>
  <h4>Scoring</h4>
  <p>+10 for capturing a piece, +20 for making a piece a king, +1000 for winning the game!</p>
